## Key Words
#### Element
An item inside a list. In the list ```[1, 2, 3]``` 1, 2, and 3 are all elements.

#### Increment
Adding a fixed number consistently. Opposite is decrement. Unlike C-based languages, Python does not suppose the ```++``` short hand to have variables increment by 1, so ```+= 1``` is used instead.

#### Index
The index is the *numerical position* of an element inside a list. Programmers count starting from zero (because it's slightly more efficent), so each number is one less than what we would normally call it in real life. In ```[1, 2, 3]```, 1 may seem like the first element, but it is actually the zeroth. 2 would be the first and 3 is the second. So to match the index with each element, it would look like 0:1, 1:2, and 2:3.

#### Iterate
Repeating a process for each element until a condition has been reached in which case it is stopped. For linear search, the process will be comparing the element with the number we are trying to locate.

#### List
A list is just a collection of numbers. This collection can contain however many numbers and each number can be of any value (we shouldn't have to worry about going over the maximum size of a list or the maximum value of a number in the scope of this lesson). For example ```[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]``` is a list and ```[10, 4, 5, 9.5, 4, 5.4]``` is another. Heck, it can even include strings (text). ```[1, 2, 'three']``` is a totally valid list. 

In some other languages, it is referred to as an *array*.

#### Return
This will give back a certain value and end the function process. For example:
```python
def giveThree():
  return 3

three = giveThree()
```
Now the variable ```three``` has been assigned the value of 3. As you can see, this is pretty useless because we could've given ```three``` the value directly instead of making a function return it, but when there is an actually something going on inside the function, returning values becomes much more... *valuable*.
